The benefits of teams working together include faster innovation, higher productivity, quicker identification of mistakes, and improved problem-solving capabilities.

What was the purpose of Google's internal project "Aristotle"?
The purpose of Google's internal project "Aristotle" was to identify the traits of high-performing teams and understand why some teams succeeded while others failed.

What were the two behaviors that all successful Google teams shared?
The two behaviors shared by all successful teams were:

Equality in distribution of conversational turn-taking (everyone spoke roughly the same amount).
High average social sensitivity (the ability to read and respond to others' emotions and nonverbal cues).
How does the distribution of conversational turn-taking contribute to successful teams?
The distribution of conversational turn-taking contributes to team success by ensuring that everyone has a chance to speak, which promotes balanced participation. When all team members share their input, it increases collective intelligence and prevents domination by a single person or group.

Social sensitivity refers to the ability to perceive and respond to others' feelings through nonverbal cues such as tone of voice or facial expressions. Teams with high social sensitivity create a psychologically safe environment, which enhances trust, respect, and overall team performance.
